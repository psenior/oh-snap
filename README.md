This web app helps you find out when your Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) funds are deposited into your Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) account each month.

I have been attending Code for Ft. Lauderdale meetups and got inspired to solve my own problems and help the community at the same time.

I am currently in career transition and my family is receiving benefits.  The funds ran out and did not renew on the 1st of the month as we assumed they would.
I logged into the ebtedge.com website to find out when they renew.  I found a complicated set of instructions telling you how to do so.
These instructions are essentially detailed specs, so I implemented them in JavaScript.  

The code isn't the best, but it works.  I'm currently going through Colt Steele's Udemy class to improve my JavaScript skills.

In the future, I may give the function a better name other than 'myFunction' and may store the caseNum as a numeric instead of a string.
